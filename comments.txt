// Just a few comments for the person checking my submission

-> I have made a new sample2.json file it to help myself understand 
the problem better and make specific test cases
-> I have changed the GetSampleData to accept a parameter so you can test the code
with any file in main.go but just replacing the filename
-> You can just type  "go test ./folder" to run all the test cases 

Side note:
You need the project in Go src file for it top work properly and so it figures out the 
paths itself


Thank you!:)
